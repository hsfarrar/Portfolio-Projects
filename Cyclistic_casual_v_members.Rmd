## Introduction

This is a case study to practice my analysis skills. The scenario is centered around a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic, who's financial analysts have determined annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. My task is to understand the ways in which casual and member users use the bikes differently, and come up with a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Sourcing My Data

While the company in this case study is fictional, I'm using real data from the last 6 months that I downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), provided by Divvy under [this licence](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Setting up my R Environment

I first install and load the `tidyverse` & `lubridate` packages.

```{r Environment, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("lubridate", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes

```

## Importing the Data into R

Next I import the raw data using the `read.csv()` function

```{r Importing the Data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/hsfdi/Desktop/cyclistic/ride_data_raw") #sets working directory

jun_2021 <- read.csv("202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jul_2021 <- read.csv("202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_2021 <- read.csv("202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep_2021 <- read.csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_2021 <- read.csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_2021 <- read.csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_2021 <- read.csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_2022 <- read.csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_2022 <- read.csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar_2022 <- read.csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr_2022 <- read.csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_2022 <- read.csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")

```

## Cleaning the Data

First, I check the data frames to make sure they all have matching column names.

```{r Column names}
colnames(jun_2021)
colnames(jul_2021)
colnames(aug_2021)
colnames(sep_2021)
colnames(oct_2021)
colnames(nov_2021)
colnames(dec_2021)
colnames(jan_2022)
colnames(feb_2022)
colnames(mar_2022)
colnames(apr_2022)
colnames(may_2022)
```

After confirming all of the columns match, I stack them into one 12 month table.

```{r Stacking tables}
all_trips <- bind_rows(jun_2021, jul_2021, aug_2021, sep_2021,
                       oct_2021, nov_2021, dec_2021, jan_2022,
                       feb_2022, mar_2022,apr_2022, may_2022)
```

I remove columns that are unnecessary for my analysis, to remove clutter, and reduce the load on my hardware.

```{r Remove extra data, warning=FALSE}
all_trips <- all_trips %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
```

I check the new table with a few different summarisation functions to get a new perspective on what to look for.

```{r Taking a fresh look}
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics
```

Since part of my analysis will focus on the difference between weekend and weekday usage, I add columns to separate the dates of each ride into month, day, and year, as well as the day of the week.

```{r Adding Date Information}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) # format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
```

I add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds), as well as ensuring it's a numeric to make sure I'm able to run calculations on the data.

```{r Calculating ride lengths}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))

is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)
```

The data frame includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative. I create a new version of the data frame (v2) since data is being removed

```{r Removing inaccuarate data}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | 
                              all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```

## Analysis

I start with a broad descriptive analysis on ride lengths.

```{r Descriptive analysis, echo=TRUE}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```

Now I take a look at the average ride lengths on any given day of the week for causal riders and annual members.

```{r Comparing days of the week}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + 
            all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

You'll notice the days of the week are out of order, that can be fixed with a small bit of code.

```{r Correcting the day order}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- 
  ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
                                             "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday",
                                             "Saturday"))

aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + 
            all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

```

Then I sort the by user type, then weekday to compare an average week for both user types.

```{r Weekdays vs. Weekends}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								# sorts
```

## Visualizing the Data

Here's a visualization showing the number of riders on a given day by rider type.

```{r Number of rides Viz}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

Notice that there are a lot more rides taken by annual members overall, but casual usage spikes on the weekends, where there are actually more casual rides taken.

Next, take a look at the average length of the rides riders are taking.

```{r Average ride length Viz}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

Casual users on average take rides that are more than twice as long as annual members, with a small dip during the week, while annual members are more consistant in their ride lengths.

## Exporting the Cleaned Data

Finally, I export a simplified table with only the rider type, day of the week, number of rides, and average ride length to examine further.

```{r Exporting}
all_trips_v3 <- all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)

write.csv(all_trips_v3, file = 'C:/Users/hsfdi/Desktop/cyclistic/all_trips.csv')

```
